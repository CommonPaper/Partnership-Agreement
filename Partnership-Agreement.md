12. <span class="header_2">General Terms</span>
    1. <span class="header_3">Entire Agreement.</span>  This Agreement is the only agreement between the parties about its subject and supersedes all prior or contemporaneous statements (whether in writing or not) about its subject.
    2. <span class="header_3">Modifications, Severability, and Waiver.</span>  Any waiver, modification, or change to the Agreement must be in writing and signed by each party. If any term of this Agreement is determined to be invalid or unenforceable by a relevant court or governing body, the remaining terms of this Agreement will remain in full force and effect. The failure of a party to enforce a term or to exercise an option or right in this Agreement will not constitute a waiver by that party of the term, option, or right.

    4. <span class="header_3">Injunctive Relief.</span>  Despite Section 5 (Escalation Procedure) and Section 12.3 (Governing Law and Chosen Courts), a breach of Section 11 (Confidentiality) or the violation of a party’s intellectual property rights may cause irreparable harm for which monetary damages cannot adequately compensate. As a result, upon the actual or threatened breach of Section 11 (Confidentiality) or violation of a party’s intellectual property rights, the non-breaching or non-violating party may seek appropriate equitable relief, including an injunction, in any court of competent jurisdiction without the need to post a bond and without limiting its other rights or remedies.
    5. <span class="header_3">Non-Exhaustive Remedies.</span>  Except where the Agreement provides for an exclusive remedy, seeking or exercising a remedy does not limit the other rights or remedies available to a party.
    6. <span class="header_3">Assignment.</span>  Neither party may assign any rights or obligations under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the other party. Any attempted but non-permitted assignment is void. This Agreement will be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties and their permitted successors and assigns.

    10. <span class="header_3">Force Majeure.</span>  Neither party will be liable for a delay or failure to perform its obligations under this Agreement if caused by a Force Majeure Event. However, this section does not excuse a party’s obligations to pay Fees.
    11. <span class="header_3">Anti-Bribery.</span>  Neither party will take any action that would be a violation of any Applicable Laws that prohibit the offering, giving, promising to offer or give, or receiving, directly or indirectly, money or anything of value to any third party to assist either party in retaining or obtaining business. Examples of these kinds of laws include the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and the UK Bribery Act 2010.
